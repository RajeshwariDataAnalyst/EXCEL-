### AI Powered Healthcare Data Insights And Dashboarding

## Project Overview and Objective:
The system collects and process medical, clinical, and operational datasets, such as patient records,
diagnosis patterns, treatment outcomes, hospital performance metrics, and resource usage.
  
Using Excel tools such as Power Query, Power Pivot, Pivot Tables, Charts, Conditional Formatting,
and basic AI-powered features, the project converts raw medical and operational data into clear, actionable insights.

## Problem Statement:
- Healthcare providers struggle to make informed decisions due to fragmented, unorganized, and complex patient and clinical data.
- Without clear insights, it becomes difficult to identify inefficiencies, predict risks, and improve quality of care.
- Critical insights into patient trends, disease patterns, and treatment outcomes often remain hidden within large datasets.
- Hospitals face challenges in understanding their operational performance across departments.Healthcare teams need a way to identify high-risk patients and emerging trends before they escalate.
